# Data Preparation - Mushrooms Project

This repository contains code for data preparation of the Mushroom Classification project. The Mushroom Classification project aims to build a model that can accurately classify mushrooms as either edible or poisonous based on their physical characteristics.

The data preparation code in this repository is written in Python and uses the Pandas library for data manipulation. It includes code for cleaning and preprocessing the raw mushroom data, as well as code for generating features to be used in the machine learning model.

## Project Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

- `data`: This folder contains the raw mushroom data and the cleaned/preprocessed data.
- `notebooks`: This folder contains Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate the data preparation code in action.
- `src`: This folder contains the source code for the data preparation pipeline.
- `README.md`: This file provides an overview of the repository.

## Usage

To use this code, you will need to have Python 3 installed, as well as the following libraries:

- Pandas
- NumPy
- scikit-learn

To run the data preparation pipeline, simply run the following command from the repository root:

```
python src/data_prep.py
```

This will preprocess the raw mushroom data and generate features for the machine learning model. The cleaned data and features will be saved in the `data` folder.

## Credits

This code was developed by Sam-ops09 as part of the Mushroom Classification project. The raw data was obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
