# Data-preparation---Mushrooms-project


This notebook is used to preprocess the "mushrooms.csv" data from the [Kaggle - Mushroom Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/mushroom-classification) project, to train a nueral network to do the classification task.
The data file is a .csv file saved in the folder **"mushrooms/data/"** of this repository.

After exploring the data, we will try to process it the best way we can to latter train a neural network to perform the classification task.
